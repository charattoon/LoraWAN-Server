LoRaWAN JS Server â€“ fast, minimalist open-source library for node that allows you to create LoRaWAN network-server.

## Features

* Handling of uplink messages from Gateways
* Scheduling of downlink data transmissions to Gateways
* Handling packets from endpoints
* Decryption packets from endpoint Nodes
* Packets creation to endpoint Nodes

Detailed, but short description of the general LoRaWAN architecture in Wiki page.

## Installation
``` bash
  $ [sudo] npm install lorawan-js
```

## Example

### Simple LoRaWAN network server

```javascript

var lorawan = require('lorawan-js');

var prop = {"port":1780};
var lwServer = new lorawan.Server(prop);

lwServer.start();

lwServer.on("ready", (info, server) => {
  console.log("Ready: ", info);
});


lwServer.on('pushdata_status', (message, clientInfo) => {
  console.log("[Upstream] IN pushdata - status message from gateway: ", message.gateway);
});

```


### LoRaWAN node package decryption


```javascript

var lorawan = require('lorawan-js');

var prop = {"port":1780};
var lwServer = new lorawan.Server(prop);

lwServer.start();

lwServer.on("ready", (info, server) => {
  console.log("Ready: ", info);
});


lwServer.on('pushdata_rxpk', (message, clientInfo) => {

  var pdata = message.data.rxpk[0].data;
  var buff = new Buffer(pdata, 'Base64');

  var MYpacket = lorawan.Packet(buff);

  console.log("[Upstream] IN pushdata RXPK - ", MYpacket.MType.Description ," from: ", MYpacket.Buffers.MACPayload.FHDR.DevAddr);

  if (MYpacket.Buffers.MACPayload.FHDR.DevAddr.toString('hex')=="be7a0000") {

     var NwkSKey = new Buffer('000102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F', 'hex');
     var AppSKey = new Buffer('000102030405060708090A0B0C0D0E0F', 'hex');

     var MYdec = MYpacket.decryptWithKeys(AppSKey, NwkSKey);

     console.log("MY Time: " + MYdec.readUInt32LE(0).toString() + " Battery: " + MYdec.readUInt8(4).toString() + " Temperature: " + MYdec.readUInt8(5).toString() + " Lat: " + MYdec.readUInt32LE(6).toString() + " - Long: " + MYdec.readUInt32LE(10).toString());

  } else if(MYpacket.Buffers.MACPayload.FHDR.DevAddr.toString('hex')=="03ff0001") {

    var NwkSKey = new Buffer('2B7E151628AED2A6ABF7158809CF4F3C', 'hex');
    var AppSKey = new Buffer('2B7E151628AED2A6ABF7158809CF4F3C', 'hex');


    var MYdec = MYpacket.decryptWithKeys(AppSKey, NwkSKey);
    console.log("MYdec: ", MYdec.toString('utf8'), " - ", MYdec.length);

  }  else {

    console.log("New device: ", MYpacket.Buffers.MACPayload.FHDR.DevAddr.toString('hex'));

  }

});

```

## Filing issues

If something isn't working like you think it should, please read the documentation, especially the Getting Started guides. If you have a question not covered in the documentation or want to report a bug, the best way to ensure it gets addressed is to file it in the appropriate issues tracker. If we can't reproduce the issue, we can't fix it. Please list the exact steps required to reproduce the issue. Include versions of your OS, Node.js, etc. Include relevant logs or sample code.

You might find a security issue: in that case, email at hello@ioberry.com.
